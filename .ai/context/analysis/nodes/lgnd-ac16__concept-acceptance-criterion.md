**AC-lgnd-16: Attack and Use resolve through one function and share one cooldown.** Channel: `build` (unit, stubbed hands and clock) + `bds`.

GIVEN P with a ready Cannon in the main hand
THEN `resolveActivation(P, "attack")` and `resolveActivation(P, "use")` both return the Cannon.

WHEN one mode activates (charges spawn)
THEN in the same tick both modes return `undefined` for 30 000 ms (± 50 ms),
AND a second Cannon copy in P's hotbar is also blocked,
AND another player R's Cannon stays ready.

GIVEN P holds a Web Sword in the main hand and a ready Cannon in the off hand
THEN `resolveActivation(P, "attack")` is `undefined`,
AND `resolveActivation(P, "use")` returns the Cannon only while the Web Sword is cooling.

GIVEN no block within 10
WHEN P presses either mode
THEN no cooldown is written and no message or sound is played.

The existing Web Sword and Scythe callers (no `mode` argument) behave as before.
