# CX-lgnd-02 · Loss return can leave a stale but still melee-usable copy (hopper/allay pickup)

**Invariant** — C-7: no duplication via craft, death, reconnect, restart. Web Sword §14: *«Нет известных способов дюпа»*.

**Design** — `L0-lgnd-p003` step 3 classifies a removed legendary item entity as *pickup* only if the instance shows up in a **player** inventory within one tick. The stable 2.10.0 API gives no removal reason, so a hopper, hopper minecart, allay or fox picking up a dropped legendary is classified as *lost* and re-issued with `gen + 1`. `L0-lgnd-r005` makes the old stack stale: it cannot cast and is deleted when it next enters a player inventory.

**Conflict.** The stale stack is still an `andrew:web_sword` / `andrew:scythe_of_calamity` item with base melee damage and infinite durability. Until a player picks it up it sits in a container, and a non-player holder (e.g. an allay, a dispenser firing it into a player's hand, a trade through a container moved by a hopper chain) keeps a second physical copy. For the ability it is not a duplicate; for melee stats it is.

**Resolution needed.** Choose: (a) accept — stale copies are harmless because they are deleted on first player contact; (b) additionally clear the watch-set entity's stack when a hopper/allay is within 1 block at removal (heuristic, costs a local query); (c) drop loss return for non-Void causes and return only on Void (narrows CTR-1). Autopilot default: (a).
