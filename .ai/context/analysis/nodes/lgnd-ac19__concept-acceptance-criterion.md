**AC-lgnd-19: The Orbital Cannon never destroys a legendary.** Channel: `bds` (GameTest `orbital:protect_*`).

GIVEN a chest holding a marked Scythe inside the LMB column,
AND a marked Web Sword item entity on the ground inside an RMB blast AABB,
AND a stone block holding nothing, for control
WHEN the Cannon fires LMB, and separately RMB
THEN the chest is gone and its ordinary contents are gone,
AND the Scythe exists as an item entity outside the column footprint, on solid ground, with the same id and gen and no `returned` message,
AND the Web Sword survives the RMB, moved outside the AABB, with the same id and gen,
AND RMB drop suppression removed no legendary,
AND neither owed list changed.

Negative check: a test effect that removes the chest **without** calling `protectLegendariesIn` makes this test fail. That proves the check sees the difference.

In the End, with no support within 16 blocks: the item goes to its holder, the gen is unchanged, and the log line says `handedBack=1`.
