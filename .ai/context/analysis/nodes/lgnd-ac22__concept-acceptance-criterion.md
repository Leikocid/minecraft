**AC-lgnd-22: Dying from a magnet fall keeps every held legendary.** Channel: `bds` (GameTest).

UFO §6 makes a fall from the hover height lethal (U2: 33 damage from 37 blocks). Retention is cause-agnostic: `entityDie` path B (`retention.ts:74-152`) does not read the damage source. This AC pins that down for the magnet.

GIVEN Survival player P holds an iron ingot in the main hand, a marked Web Sword in the off hand, and a marked Scythe and a marked Orbital Cannon in the hotbar
WHEN the magnet lifts P to the hold point, the magnet releases, and P dies from the fall
THEN on respawn P holds exactly those three instances (same ids, same gen; the Web Sword is in the inventory or off hand),
AND no item entity of any of them exists at the landing spot, or in the saucer's cloud after the death,
AND the iron ingot dropped as a vanilla death drop,
AND no owed entry and no `returned` message was produced.

Variant: the same after `/andrew:ufo stop` mid-hold, and after a server restart between death and respawn.
