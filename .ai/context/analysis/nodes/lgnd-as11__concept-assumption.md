**ASM-lgnd-11: Unmarked copies (vanilla `/give`, Creative) are ordinary items. They cast, but get no legendary protection.**

Orbital §4 allows these copies "for testing". Spec AC-20 says "the Orbital Cannon and all legendary weapons survive death and ordinary destruction", but does not say whether test copies are included.

What unmarked copies get under this assumption:
- **Cast:** yes, sharing the player's cooldown (Orbital §7, AC-17; `as05`).
- **Protection:** none. No death retention, loss return or `protectLegendariesIn` move. They die, burn and vanish as vanilla items.

Why:
- Each protection writes a durable token.
- Unmarked copies are unlimited, so protecting them grows `_owed`/`_pending` without bound (`as06`).
- It protects nothing scarce.

**Impact if wrong.** If the client wants every copy protected, the gate stamps `origin: "admin"` on the first inventory sighting of an unmarked `itemId` (no flag change).
- This is one branch in `craftgate.ts`.
- The owed list then needs a cap (drop the oldest `admin` entries).
- The `ac09` "unmarked destroyed as vanilla" clause inverts.
