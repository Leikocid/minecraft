**AC-lgnd-13: Busy blocks re-use, expires by deadline, and hands off to cooldown without a gap.** Channel: `build` (unit) + `bds`.

This is rewritten to the as-built durable busy deadline (`ad07` §2).

GIVEN `setBusy(P, "scythe_of_calamity", ms)`
THEN `isReady` is false, and a Use press with the Scythe in the main hand does not call its ability. The HUD keeps showing the Scythe line; there is no `active` segment.

WHEN `clearBusy` and `startCooldown` are called in the same turn
THEN no tick observes `isReady == true`.

WHEN `clearBusy` is called alone
THEN the ability is ready at once.

AND after a server restart with busy set, the ability becomes ready no later than the stored deadline.

AND the Orbital Cannon never sets busy.
