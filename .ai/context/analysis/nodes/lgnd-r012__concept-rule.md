**R-lgnd-012: Legendary destruction policy (all weapons)**

A **live marked** legendary is never lost to ordinary destruction. Which outcome applies depends on the cause:

| Cause | Outcome | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| This add-on removes blocks or detonates (Cannon LMB/RMB, any future effect) | **Stays in the world.** Same stack, same `gen`, placed at a safe spot outside the volume. No message. | `protectLegendariesIn` (`p008`) is called **before** the removal |
| RMB drop suppression | Legendary item entities are **never** removed | `isLegendaryItemEntity` exemption (`ring`) |
| Vanilla container break (player, TNT, creeper) | **Drops** as an item entity (vanilla spill) | none; the drop is then watched |
| Item entity burnt (fire, lava), cactus, vanilla explosion, despawn | **Returned** to the last holder with `gen + 1`, plus a private `returned` message; queued in the owed list if the holder is offline | `p003` (deviation C-16) |
| Void (below `heightRange.min`) | Returned, as above (Orbital §5) | `p003` |

Invariants:
- No path grants a copy while a live copy exists. A `gen` bump always comes before a re-issue, and a protective move never bumps `gen` (C-7).
- Unmarked (Creative, `/give`) copies are outside this rule. They behave as vanilla items (`as11`).
- The craft flag is never reopened by any destruction (`r011`).
- The Web Sword, the Scythe and the Cannon are treated the same (Orbital §5 "общее правило").
