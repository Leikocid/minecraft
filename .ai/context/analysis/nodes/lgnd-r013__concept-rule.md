**R-lgnd-013: Container-destruction rule**

When a block with an inventory (chest, trapped chest, barrel, hopper, dropper, dispenser, furnace family, brewing stand, shulker box, crafter, decorated pot) that holds a live marked legendary is destroyed, the legendary must survive or drop, never vanish (Orbital §5).

1. **Script removal** (`setType`, `fillBlocks`, `structureManager` overwrite, the Cannon LMB): the caller runs `protectLegendariesIn` over the affected volume **before** the first block change of that tick. Removing such a block without the call is a defect. `ac19` detects it.
2. **Script explosion** (`createExplosion`, the Cannon RMB): the helper runs over the blast AABB (centre ± power) before `createExplosion`. Ordinary contents may then be suppressed (`L0-xasm7`), and a legendary cannot be among them.
3. **Vanilla destruction:** rely on the vanilla spill. The dropped legendary falls under `r012` from then on.
4. **Death of the previous owner** while the legendary sits in a container: nothing happens (Orbital §5). Retention reads only the dying player's own inventory and off hand.
5. **Nested storage** (a legendary inside a shulker-box *item* or a bundle): out of reach of every rule here. Known limit, `cx12`.
6. Containers are never scanned outside a destruction volume (C-4). The helper runs only on demand.
