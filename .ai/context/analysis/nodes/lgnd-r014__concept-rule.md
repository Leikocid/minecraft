**R-lgnd-014: Only a craft token can claim or spend a weapon's craft budget**

- A weapon's one-per-world flag (`andrew:<p>_crafted`) is set only when a `def.craftTokenId` stack reaches a Survival or Adventure player's inventory while the flag is unset.
- A token that arrives while the flag is set is refunded with `def.refund`, and the `craft_blocked` message is sent.
- A plain `def.itemId` stack never claims and is never refunded. That covers vanilla `/give`, the Creative inventory, a Creative copy handed to a Survival player, a structure loot table, and `/replaceitem`. Such a stack stays unmarked, and the gate does not look at it.
- A token in Creative or Spectator is swapped for an unmarked `def.itemId`. The flag is unchanged.
- The token → weapon swap keeps the slot index. Only the `claim` branch stamps `origin: craft`, `owner` = `holder` = the crafter, and `gen: 0`.
- Contract on item JSON, owned by the weapon nodes:
  - Every legendary recipe outputs its token.
  - The token has `menu_category: none`, the weapon's icon and name, and `max_stack_size: 1`.
- `/andrew:<cmd> reset` clears the flag (unchanged). It does not delete tokens that are in flight.
