**ASM-lgnd-12: Engine behaviour behind `protectLegendariesIn` (probe on BDS 1.26.51.x)**

1. `Dimension.getBlocks(volume, { includeTypes })` is stable in `@minecraft/server` 2.10.0. It filters engine-side, so a query of about 9³ (one RMB detonation) or about 5×5×384 (one LMB column) costs well under 1 ms per call.
2. `block.getComponent("inventory").container` is readable and writable for chests, barrels, hoppers, shulker boxes and the other inventory blocks, and `setItem(i)` removes a slot.
3. `setType("minecraft:air")` on a container **deletes** its contents without spawning item entities. That is the reason the extraction has to come before it.
4. `createExplosion` on a container **spills** its contents as new item entities. That is the reason RMB suppression must exempt legendaries.
5. `dimension.spawnItem(stack, loc)` keeps the stack's dynamic properties (the mark). The shipped death path B already relies on this for re-grant.

**Impact if wrong.**
- If (1) is not stable or is slow: iterate `getBlock` over the volume inside the Cannon's own removal job (pass a per-block `protectBlock(block)` instead). The cost moves into `pntr`'s job budget.
- If (3) spills contents: tier 1 is still needed for RMB, and the LMB step becomes a safety net.
- If (5) drops properties: re-drop through `new ItemStack` plus a re-stamp.
