**R-lgnd-015: Activation modes share one cooldown and resolve through one function**

- `resolveActivation(player, mode)` is the only place that decides which held legendary a press activates. Every ability module calls it and acts only if the answer is its own def.
- `mode = "use"`: main hand, then off hand. Each is a candidate only if `"use" ∈ def.activations`, it is ready and it is not busy.
- `mode = "attack"`: main hand only, and only if `"attack" ∈ def.activations`, it is ready and it is not busy.
- All modes of one def share the def's `abilityKey`, and so share one cooldown and one busy deadline. While cooling, every mode resolves to `undefined`. The press creates nothing and sends no message (Orbital §6).
- The ability module calls `startCooldown` in the same synchronous turn as a successful activation. For the Cannon that is the charge spawn, never the hit. So at most one activation happens per player per tick, across modes.
- The cooldown is per player and ability. Several copies held by one player (Creative, `/give`) share it, and different players are independent (Orbital §7, AC-17).
- A press that finds no valid target writes no state.
