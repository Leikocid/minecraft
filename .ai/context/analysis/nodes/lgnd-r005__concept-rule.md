**R-lgnd-005: At most one live generation per instance.**

Source: C-7 (now including Void return). Every return path is a duplication primitive unless the returned copy supersedes the lost one.

- A marked stack is live iff its `gen` equals the ledger generation for its `(prefix, id)`.
- Re-issuing a lost instance bumps the generation **before** the new stack exists, in the same synchronous turn.
- A stale stack:
  - cannot cast (the dispatcher treats it as absent);
  - is deleted on death, not retained;
  - is not watched or returned;
  - is deleted on the first `playerInventoryItemChange` that shows it in any player's inventory, with a private `voided` message.
- Nothing lowers a generation. `reset` does not touch generations.

**Consequence:** a mis-classified "lost" copy may still exist physically (for example in a hopper chest), but it can never be a second usable legendary.
