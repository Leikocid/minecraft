**R-lgnd-009: Busy semantics.**

Source: ASM-017, ADR-025, and the decomposition-plan contract `cooldown.{isReady, isBusy, setBusy, start, remaining}`.

- `busy` means a multi-tick activation of that ability is in progress (a Scythe volley). While busy, `isReady` is false, a second Use of that weapon does nothing and says nothing, and the HUD shows `active`.
- busy and cooldown are independent:
  - A volley ending with 0 hits clears busy and does **not** start a cooldown (Scythe §5).
  - A volley ending with ≥ 1 hit clears busy **and** starts the cooldown in one turn, so no tick sees `isReady` true.
- busy is memory-only. It is false after a restart and cleared when the owner leaves. It is never persisted, so it can never strand an ability in "active".
- The Web Sword never sets busy. Its behaviour is unchanged.
